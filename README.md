# RESILIENT
A RulE baSed atrIaL fIber gENeraTor.

## Overview
RESILIENT is a rule-based artial fiber generator for generating bi-atrial fibers and interatrial bridges. The algortihm was developed at IBT and published under [[1](#1)]. The algrothim works with surface, terahedron  and voxel meshes. The fibers based on 22 seedpoint, 9 in the right atrium and 13 in the left atrium. They have to be selected by the user according to [[1](#1)].

## Requirements
To install and run RESILIENT you need:

- VTK (https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk),
- Cork (https://github.com/gilbo/cork), 
- Tetgen (https://github.com/pyvista/tetgen),
- GMP (https://gmplib.org) ???


## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/KIT-IBT/RESILIENT.git
cd Resilient

cmake .
make install
```
